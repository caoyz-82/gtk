/**
 * SECTION:gskpathbuilder
 * @Title: Building paths
 * @Short_description: Building paths of lines and curves
 * @See_also: #GskPath, #GskPathMeasure
 *
 * This section describes how to construct #GskPath structures.
 *
 * A path is constructed like this:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GskPath *
 * construct_path (void)
 * {
 *   GskPathBuilder *builder;
 *
 *   builder = gsk_path_builder_new ();
 *
 *   // add contours to the path here
 *
 *   return gsk_path_builder_free_to_path (builder);
 * ]|
 *
 * Adding contours to the path can be done in two ways.  
 * The easiest option is to use the `gsk_path_builder_add_*` group
 * of functions that add predefined contours to the current path,
 * either common shapes like gsk_path_builder_add_circle()
 * or by adding from other paths like gsk_path_builder_add_path().
 *
 * The other option is to define each line and curve manually with
 * the `gsk_path_builder_*_to` group of functions. You start with
 * a call to gsk_path_builder_move_to() to set the starting point
 * and then use multiple calls to any of the drawing functions to
 * move the pen along the plane. Once you are done, you can call
 * gsk_path_builder_close() to close the path by connecting it
 * back with a line to the starting point.
 * This is similar for how paths are drawn in Cairo.
